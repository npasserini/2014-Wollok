	abstract = {This paper discusses some ideas related to the introduction of the 
object oriented programming paradigm to students with previous 
knowledge about programming in a procedural style, making 
focus on the difficulties arisen when working with the concepts of 
class and instance. First, the order of topic presentation is altered 
delaying the appearance of the class concept. Then, the usage of 
an instance-based programming environment, lacking the concept 
of class, constructed over Dolphin Smalltalk is analyzed. Finally, 
results are described which show that students are able to do more 
complex exercises, to improve the relationship between theory 
and practice and to have a better overall comprehension of the 
main ideas of the paradigm.},
