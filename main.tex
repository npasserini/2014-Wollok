\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

% Context

% Problem

\medskip 

% Known tracks for solutions
% here you want to show that you are not an idiot not knowing what have been around


\medskip 

% What our solution is \ct{Set} and \ct{OrderedCollection} (so that the reader knows where the paper is going)

\section{Problem Description}
\label{sec:problem}

Context, exposed with the \textbf{most precise terms possible} (don't open
unwanted doors for the reader)


Probably set the vocabulary before to cut any misinterpretation

Constraints that influenced the solution (because the solution is not
universal) \emph{e.g.} our requirements for a solution, possibly not all
satisfied. They should be sound and believable. Analysis of the criteria.
Imagine that you are another guy having this problem do the constraint
matches yours so that you could apply the solution

% Problem

% Factual solution tracks, to position...

% Our solution in a nutshell.


\section{Proposed Solution}
\label{sec:contribution}
% Free form, variable number of sections, technical details.
% But in general do not mix solution and discussions/possible variation let that for discussion

% Acá se podría incluir el material de http://pharorwrules.wordpress.com/2013/06/09/a-look-into-the-rewrite-tool/


\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

% Discussion of actual solution \emph{vs.} initial constraints from \ref{sec:problem}. Explain the space of the solution, why we made it this way.

% Evaluation of the solution. How does the solution meet the criteria? Where does it succeed or fails...


\section{Related Works}
\label{sec:related}

% Other solutions in the domain, and a real comparison of our contribution with solutions from other people.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we looked at problem P with this context and these
constraints. We proposed solution S. It has such good points and such not so
good ones. Now we could do this or that.
