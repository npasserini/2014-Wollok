\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

% In this paper, we looked at problem P with this context and these
% constraints. We proposed solution S. It has such good points and such not so
% good ones. 


Wollok is an educative, object-oriented programming language which is accompanied by an advanced programming environment.
Both tools are highly customized to give support to an introductory OOP course.
Our approach consists of the combination of these three cornerstones.

First, an \emph{incremental\np{Revisar la idea de Javi} learning path} choosing exactly which are the concepts we want to teach and the order we want to teach them.
The learning path starts with a \emph{simplified programming model} (SPM), \ie one which uses less concepts than a full-fledged OOP language.
The SPM allows the student to build simple programs without requiring more advanced concepts.
The path should attach the SPM with a good set of programming exercises, specifically oriented to be easy to build in the selected SPM.
Once the student has mastered the concepts on the SPM, we can go a step further and introduce the next set of concepts.
\np{Acá se podría hablar de constructivismo.}

Next, defining our own programming language, allows us to give full support to the selected learning path, 
avoiding the need of explaining complex concepts too soon in the course or forcing the student to write boilerplate code which he cannot yet understand.

Finally, a good programming environment, helps detecting errors, provides guidance and most significantly allows the student to \emph{explore}.
We have found that often students are afraid to search for solutions not seen in the class or test their own ideas, 
which leads them to restricting themselves into a smaller set of concepts and tools they feel more secure about.
A controlled environment empowers students to look around and explore new possibilities.

% Now we could do this or that.
\label{sec:furtherWork}
One major objective in our future work is the integration of more \emph{automatic user interaction} tools into the Wollok environment.
Our objective is to enable the students to have visual and interactive programs without requiring them to learn the subleties of GUI building, 
extending the ideas in Gobstones \cite{lopez_nombre_2012} to object-oriented domains.
Some advances in this area can be seen in our previous work named Hoope \cite{hoope}.

The second major objective is to continue improving the detection of programming errors.
A cornerstone to achieve this goal is the type inferer, which is our current focus.
The other half of our future work in this area is a powerfull \emph{effect system} \cite{effect system}.

Another characteristic of programming in the real world is the need to work in teams. 
The success of object-oriented languages is partly due to their advantages in group projects. 
It is necessary teach our students about the techniques needed for teamwork, right from the beginning. 
To do this, it is essential that the environment has some form of support for group work \cite{kolling_problem_1999}.
Also we want to include more \emph{automatic refactorings}.

% No sé si vale la pena decir lo que sigue

% 
% Finally, our long term objective is to test wollok in different environments, such as in high school or in courses for students without any previous programming experience.
% 
% - Una versión web / versión liviana con el objetivo de poder ejecutarse en las netbooks que tienen los chicos de secundaria.
% 
% % Probar la nueva herramienta en entornos educativos.
% 
% Eso pensando el lenguaje/herramienta, si pienso a nivel docencia se me ocurre que lo que tenemos que hacer es integrarnos con otras entidades, como Sadosky u otras universidades.
% Haciendo foco en que el punto no es la herramienta sino que tenemos que repensar cómo enseñamos a programar.
