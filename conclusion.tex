\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

% In this paper, we looked at problem P with this context and these
% constraints. We proposed solution S. It has such good points and such not so
% good ones. 


Wollok is an educative, object-oriented programming language which is accompanied by an advanced programming environment.
Both tools are highly customized to give support to an introductory OOP course.
Our approach consists of the combination of these three cornerstones.

First, an \emph{incremental\np{Revisar la idea de Javi} learning path} choosing exactly which are the concepts we want to teach and the order we want to teach them.
The learning path starts with a \emph{simplified programming model} (SPM), \ie one which uses less concepts than a full-fledged OOP language.
The SPM allows the student to build simple programs without requiring more advanced concepts.
The path should attach the SPM with a good set of programming exercises, specifically oriented to be easy to build in the selected SPM.
Once the student has mastered the concepts on the SPM, we can go a step further and introduce the next set of concepts.
\np{Acá se podría hablar de constructivismo.}

Next, defining our own programming language, allows us to give full support to the selected learning path, 
avoiding the need of explaining complex concepts too soon in the course or forcing the student to write boilerplate code which he cannot yet understand.

Finally, a good programming environment, helps detecting errors, provides guidance and most significantly allows the student to \emph{explore}.
We have found that often students are afraid to search for solutions not seen in the class or test their own ideas, 
which leads them to restricting themselves into a smaller set of concepts and tools they feel more secure about.
A controlled environment empowers students to look around and explore new possibilities.

% Now we could do this or that.

\label{sec:furtherWork}

One future step in the development of Wollok can be adding an interactive user interface to display the program and allow the students to see the effects of their programs. For this, we are expanding the work already done in Hoope with many base ideas taken from Gobstones. 

Another characteristic of programming in the real world is the need to work in
teams. The success of object-oriented languages is partly due to their advantages in
group projects. Ideally, we also want to teach our students about the techniques
needed for teamwork. To do this, it is essential that the environment has some form
of support for group work. \cite{kolling_problem_1999}. So we will be working on an easy way of integration with Version Control Systems tools.

Also we are working in adding more automatic refactor tools, and a better type inference implementation. Even working on adding an effect system to detect correct usage of the language and the code conventions.

One of the important development steps to be done is the implementation of a web version or a lighter version, using less hardware requirements, with the aim to run the solution in small netbooks like the ones in the program Conectar Igualdad \footnote{http://www.conectarigualdad.gob.ar/}

Finally, in the educational use of the tool, we will be testing it in different educational environments to get feedback about the learning experience; generating learning material (\eg examples, exercises, guides). As the focus of the tool is to provide a new way of teaching programming skills. For this objective, we will be working in collaboration with Universities, Teachers and non profit organizations.
